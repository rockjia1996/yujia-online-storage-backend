# To Do List

## Tasks

### Long terms

-[] Replace frontend with React.js.
-[] Test more on the file upload / download / deletion.
There seem to be a directory not found error pops
up randomly. Try to catch the bug.
-[] Considering / Experimenting more customized middlewares with express
and mongoose to optmize the pipeline.

### Short terms

-[] Replace the path literal with the actual built-in path object
(the current implemention is mad ugly and not portable to windows)
-[] Add constraint on the size of the files.
-[] Simulate the bad network connection from the client-end. See
if any bug that may cause.
